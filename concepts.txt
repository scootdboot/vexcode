will eventually convert to commands
- convert initally to rectangles with width/length 1 and change later
    - will have to compare a ridiculous number of strings (i imagine inefficient)
    - will potentially not require looping through
vs
- store all the rectangles in an array and use it to more easily check for length/width 1 before code
    - extra loops through
    - cleaner to read

also - WE DON'T HAVE TO WRITE SEQUENTIALLY!!!! WE CAN SAVE LINES BY WRITING ALL PIXELS OF ONE COLOR AT ONCE
